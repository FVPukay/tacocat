# Tacocat
* Users who have signed up can post the kinds of tacos that they have been eating!
* This app uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)
* The ORM is [Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/#)

I started with broken tests and made the tests pass to enable the functionality in the app

## Backend
* See [tacocat.py](https://github.com/FVPukay/tacocat/blob/topic-br-1/tacocat.py) for app setup and routes
* See [models.py](https://github.com/FVPukay/tacocat/blob/topic-br-1/models.py)
* See [forms.py](https://github.com/FVPukay/tacocat/blob/topic-br-1/forms.py)
* See [tests.py](https://github.com/FVPukay/tacocat/blob/topic-br-1/app_tests.py) for the tests I made pass
