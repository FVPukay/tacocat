# Tacocat Project

## Summary

This is an app that will let signed up users post the kinds of tacos that
they have been eating!

Users can register using the sign up button at the top of the page, can
login after registering, and can then post tacos.


This project allowed me to practice building from a spec and to write code
against tests.

## Project Specifications:

### Users

* User accounts have an email address and a password
* User email addresses are unique
* Passwords are hashed
* Logged in users see menu items for log out and to create a taco
* Logged out users see menu items to log in or sign up

### Tacos

* Tacos have a protein, a shell, a true/false for cheese, and a freeform area for extras
* Once entered, tacos show up on the home page
* If there aren't any tacos, users will see a message saying that there are no tacos
